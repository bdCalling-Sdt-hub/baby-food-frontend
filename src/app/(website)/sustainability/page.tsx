        At Cove Valley, we believe in making choices that are not only good for
        babies but also good for the planet. Currently, our focus is on sourcing
        organic ingredients from trusted farms that prioritize natural,
        eco-friendly farming methods. We are committed to evolving our approach
        and making sustainability an integral part of Cove Valley’s growth. We
        believe that small steps lead to big changes!

      <p className="mt-5">
        We’re mindful of the materials we use to store and package our products.
        Our ice trays are made from polypropylene (PP), which is a durable,
        recyclable, and eco-friendly plastic.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        Our freezer bags are made from PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), PE
        (Polyethylene), and MOPP (Metallized Oriented Polypropylene)—three
        materials that offer significant benefits: Superior durability,
        excellent moisture barrier protection, and enhanced freshness retention,
        ensuring your baby’s food stays safe and delicious.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        We believe in nourishing not just our little ones but also our planet.
        While we recognize that achieving full sustainability is a journey, we
        are committed to using recyclable materials and promoting eco-friendly
        practices. Our goal is to minimize waste and ensure transparency in our
        processes. Together, we can create a healthier future for our children
        and the Earth.
